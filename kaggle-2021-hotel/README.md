This repository contains some of my codings and notes of the 2021 kaggle *Hotel-ID to Combat Human Trafficking 2021 - FGVC8* competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/hotel-id-2021-fgvc8) which ran in Spring 2021.

The competition contained 97000+ images of hotel rooms from 7700 different hotels around the world. The objective was to identify the hotel of 13000 images from the hidden test set. The metric of the competition was Mean Average Precission of the top 5 picks (MAP@5). My solution scored **14th place** out of 92 teams.
